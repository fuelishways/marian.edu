    <h2 class="sectionheading">What programs are offered?</h2>
    <p>Our two-year college will offer three associate degree programs to prepare students for career success in a range of employment settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Business administration</li>
      <li>Information technology</li>
      <li>Liberal arts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will also provide students with the support, foundational knowledge and skills they need to continue their college journeys and apply the credits they've earned toward a bachelor's degree, whether at Marian University or another accredited institution. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The associate's degree program is envisioned as primarily non-residential, which means students won't incur the room and board fees associated with campus living. Instead, students will live off-campus and commute for classroom activities and to use library and computer resources.</li>
      <li>Because this joint venture with St. Joseph's College allows for a sharing of assets, students will have access to unrivaled student services, including a student health center, fitness center, Writing Center, Speaking Studio, and other amenities.</li>
      <li>Some students may be eligible to participate in varsity athletic programs.</li>
    </ul>
