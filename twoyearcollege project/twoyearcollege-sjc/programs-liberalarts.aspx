        <h2 class="sectionheading"><small>Program description:</small></h2>
        <p>Liberal arts exposes you to a variety of subjects and skills that will enhance your critical thinking and communication skills, and provide credits that are easily transferable into a four-year institution. </p>
        <p>You will learn about general global issues, human interactions, and business principles allowing you to analyze and cross-connect diverse topics. Through liberal arts you will discover which topics interest you, what you are passionate
          about, and how to apply your strengths into a profession. </p>
        <p>You can choose to focus on arts and sciences, or social sciences. The arts and sciences track focuses on speaking and writing skills crucial to success in any workplace. Through the social science track you can pursue a career in
          sociology, psychology, social work, or health and human services.</p>


        <h2 class="sectionheading"><small>Credits and classes:</small></h2>
        <p>To earn our 64-credit business administration associate degree, you will complete 34-general education credit hours and 30-liberal arts focused credit hours in 24 months.</p>
        <p>A new cohort begins classes together each summer, and will graduate together in 24 months. Without taking long breaks and attending class year-round, you are able to stay completely connected to supportive faculty and all the top-notch
          resources on campus.</p>
        <p>Students will attend class two days per week, all day. The other three days each week class will not be held to ensure students have ample time to work so you can earn while you learn.</p>
        <p>Early in the program students will build written, oral, and teamwork skills while fulfilling general education requirements. In addition to class work, time is built into the schedule for studying or meeting with faculty and classmates.</p>
        <p><strong>Sample of a daily schedule:</strong></p>
        <table class="hover">
          <tr>

        <h2 class="sectionheading"><small>Plug-in to your program</small> </h2>
        <p><strong>Information Technology Plug-In</strong> <br>Your business administration program can be complemented by an Information Technology “plug-in” concentration. You can use elective hours to take courses in computer science, work with a coding academy, or gain credit for other tech associated experiences. “Plug-ins” make you a more flexible, versatile employee, and expand options in pursuing your bachelor’s degree.</p>



        <h2 class="sectionheading"><small>Paths after graduation:</small></h2>
        <p><strong>Bachelor Degree options:</strong><br>After completing your associate degree, you will receive direct admittance to Marian University to complete your bachelor’s degree. All of your credits will transfer, and most students will complete their bachelor’s degree in two years.</p>
        <p>You can also transfer your credits to another four-year institution. We will help you identify which path is the right fit for you, and develop a plan to ensure you continue to achieve your goals.</p>
