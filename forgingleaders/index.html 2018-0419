                    <p>Since our inception we have responded to the needs of our communities. When schools needed teachers, we opened our doors as a teaching college. When hospitals needed nurses, we started a nursing program. When a doctor shortage seemed imminent, we opened the state’s first new medical school in more than a century. Yes, we have a rich history of rising to the challenge, seeing a need, filling it, and, ultimately, making the world a better place. But we’re just getting started.</p>
                    <p>Leaders are needed now more than ever. Whether in education, healthcare, business, ministry, or public service, we need people who care, individuals who will make an impact and inspire others to do the same. Join us in forging leaders who have, can, and will change the world. This is the legacy we’re made for.</p>
